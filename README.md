```
If you're including Corder in a Swift project, make sure you also have:

```
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
```

2. Import Corder framework in AppDelegate

    Swift
    ```swift
    import Corder
    ```

    Objective-C
    ```objc
    #import <Corder/Corder.h>
    ```

3. In AppDelegate: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions append following lines:

    Swift
    ```swift
    Corder.initWithApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
    Corder.startReconding()
    ```

    Objective-C
    ```objc
    [Corder initWithApiKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY"];
    [Corder startReconding];
    ```

First Launch
---

1. Launch the app with the embedded Corder iOS SDK.
2. Let the app work for a few seconds then press the Home button to minimize it. After that, the app uploads the video with your session to the server.
    
    **IMPORTANT:** Don't terminate the application, just press Home button to minimize it and wait for a few seconds while the video is uploading.
3. Then open the list of the sessions to review your recorded videos.
